# Assignment #4 Setup Instructions

## Step #0 Create a Twitter Developer Account
**DO THIS FIRST!** It may take some time for Twitter to approve you! Read the instructions in Glow and watch the Assignment 4 video for directions on how to do this.

## Step #1 Ensure you have all programming modules
This week, in addition to Anaconda Python 3.6 (or greater) with Jupyter Notebooks and pandas, you'll also need to install the `tweepy` and `fastai` modules. You can often do this with a `pip install tweepy` and `pip install fastai` command.

Install Anaconda Python 3.6 (or greater) if you haven't already. [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) You'll need Jupyter Notebook, and pandas, at the very least.

## Step #2 Download homework files
Download all the files in this repository. Place these files into a well-named folder on your computer, and click on the zip file to unzip the data folder. You will zip all the files in this directory and submit the `.zip` file to Glow when completed.

## Step #3 (Terminal Option)
In your terminal, navigate to your homework folder and run `jupyter notebook .` to start the notebook. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

## Step #3 (Graphical User Interface Option)
Once Anaconda is installed on your machine, open an application called Anaconda-Navigator. On the main page, click the 'launch' button on the Jupyter Notebook tile. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

On Windows, you will do [something like this](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/opening-a-jupyter-notebook-on-windows.html) by running the 'Anaconda Prompt' that comes with the Anaconda distribution.

## Step #4
Once you have the Jupyter Notebook for this assignment open, then follow the instructions described therein. 

# Jupyter Notebooks
If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, a good first step for you would be to read the [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: The Definitive Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook) and take the User Interface Tour in the Jupyter notebook Help menu once you've opened your first Jupyter Notebook.
